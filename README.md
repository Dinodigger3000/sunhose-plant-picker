## Description of the Project

Sunhose plant picker is a React JS Web App hosted on Firebase that enables users to build a profile of their living space and personal preferences, and receive a list of reccomended plants. Our goal with this project was to create a blend of artistic and functional design, and to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate and interact with the app.

## FAQ

- **How was plant data collected?**

Plant data and standards for profile building such as light and care levels were collected from The Complete Guide to Indoor Plants.
Specific information about each plant were collected from [The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Main_Page).

- **How was plant data stored, and how many plants are there?**
  Plant data is stored in a Firebase database, and there are currently 18 plants in the database. The database was designed with scalability in mind, and can be easily expanded to include more plants.

- **How were the 3D models and designs created and implemented?**
  All featured 3D models were created using Blender, and implemented using React Three Fiber.
